#Using Java API of Ant 

Using Java API of Ant is a mini project that shows how to use Java API of Ant Build Tool to build Java projects at runtime using Java platform.

It shows how one can use Java POJO code to build another Java project on the fly without even installing Ant's command line interface. All one need to do is to import Ant-*.jar to her Java project and build other Java projects, whether the other project is a desktop application made using Swing or a web application made using good ol' Servlets. It even allows to create .war files to be readily deployed to servers.

This project was made due to lack availability of good tutorials on how to exploit Ant's Java API on Internet.
